Multi-sided surfaces are indispensable to modeling free-form shapes, but their representation is non-standard. Typical workarounds include approximation and trimming, or splitting them into quadrilaterals. In this paper we investigate exact conversion methods of some well-known genuine n-sided surface representations - such as S-patches, and surfacing schemes by Warren, Kato and Charrot-Gregory - into rational tensor product patches. We deal with various practical issues, such as computational efficiency, the quality of the control net, and singularities. We discuss the pros and cons of the above methods, and compare them through several interesting examples.
